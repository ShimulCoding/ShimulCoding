I'm Shimul Chowdhury, a Computer Science & Engineering undergraduate at Metropolitan University, Sylhet. My work spans machine learning research, full-stack web development, and the kind of algorithmic thinking that comes from years of competitive programming. I don't just learn technology — I apply it to build things that matter.

Maintaining a CGPA of 3.94 / 4.00 — earning the Vice Chancellor's Scholarship in 2025 — reflects the same discipline I bring to every project: structured thinking, thorough execution, and a refusal to ship something I'm not proud of. My earthquake prediction project isn't just a class exercise; it's a two-stage ML pipeline built on real government seismic data.

I've also built production-quality systems — a complete University Club Management Portal using PHP, MySQL, and TailwindCSS, with a 3NF normalized database and full admin dashboard. That's the kind of work that teaches you how real software is built, not just how it's theorized.

On top of that, I've solved 200+ competitive programming problems on Codeforces — dynamic programming, graph theory, greedy, binary search. That discipline sharpens ML intuition in ways no textbook can. I'm now actively seeking a thesis or research opportunity to push this further.
